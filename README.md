# Eye Wink Classifier

![A picture of myself with the IDUN Guardian Earbuds](/docs/imgs/thumbnail.png)

This repository contains the code for the project eye wink classifier, which was the final project for the SIT Academy's [Applied Machine Learning](https://learning.constructor.org/remote/applied-machine-learning) bootcamp. In this project, I tried to create a machine learning model that can detect whether a person blinks or not and wether they blink with the left or the right eye. The model was trained with a small dataset that I created myself using the [IDUN Guardian Earbuds](https://iduntechnologies.com/idun-guardian) in-ear EEG device as depicted in the image above.
